Write a program to generate the following series 95.0, 115.5, 138.0,..., 189.0 
Input format: 
The input containing an integer which denotes 'n' 
Output format:
Print the series and refer the sample output for formatting
Sample Input & Output:
5
95.0 115.5 138.0 162.5 189.0 

SOLUTION:


n=int(input())
s=95.0
c=2
for i in range(1,n+1):
    print(s)
    s=s+18.5+c
    c=c+2
